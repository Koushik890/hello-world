Enter into the new world

Hi Everyone!

I am now a student and interested in technology and coding things since the age of 10 or 12. But I won't say I know too much about programming or developing.I'm just learning all sorts of these things and the good thing is I've now a much time to learn and i'm just tryingg to utilize that.Nowadays, I got a much interest in Web Development and I'm looking further to build more skills and share those feelings and skills with all the others.
